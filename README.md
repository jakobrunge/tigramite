## General Notes

Tigramite is a causal time series analysis python package. It allows to efficiently reconstruct causal graphs from high-dimensional time series datasets and model the obtained causal dependencies for causal mediation and prediction analyses. Causal discovery is based on linear as well as non-parametric conditional independence tests applicable to discrete or continuously-valued time series. Also includes functions for high-quality plots of the results. Please cite the following papers depending on which method you use:

## Features

- high detection power even for large-scale time series datasets
- flexible conditional independence test statistics adapted to
  continuously-valued or discrete data, and different assumptions about
  linear or nonlinear dependencies
- automatic hyperparameter optimization for most tests
- parallel computing script based on mpi4py
- handling of missing values and masks
- p-value correction and confidence interval estimation
- causal mediation class to analyze causal pathways
- prediction class based on sklearn models including causal feature selection


## Required python packages

- numpy>=1.10.0
- scipy>=0.17.0
- scikit-learn>=0.18.1   (optional, necessary for GPDC test)
- matplotlib>=1.5.1
- networkx=1.10.0
- cython>=0.26   (optional, necessary for CMIknn and GPDC tests)
- basemap>=1.0.0   (only if plotting on a map is needed)
- mpi4py>=2.0.0   (optional, necessary for using the parallelized implementation)
- statsmodels >= 0.6.0   (optional, necessary for p-value corrections)
- rpy2>=2.8   (optional, necessary for RCOT test)


## Installation

python setup.py install

This will install tigramite in your path.

To use just the ParCorr and CMIsymb independence tests, only numpy and scipy are required. For other independence tests more packages are required:

- CMIknn: cython can optionally be used for compilation, otherwise the provided ``*.c'' file is used 

- GPDC: also based on cython, and additionally, scikit-learn is required for Gaussian Process regression

- RCOT requires more work: Firstly, rpy2 is required to access R-packages. The required R-packages can be installed with the script ``install_r_packages.sh''
