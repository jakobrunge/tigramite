## Overview

It's best to start with our [Overview/review paper: Causal inference for time series](https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite/blob/master/tutorials/Runge_Causal_Inference_for_Time_Series_NREE.pdf)

__Update:__ Tigramite now has a new CausalEffects class that allows to estimate (conditional) causal effects and mediation based on assuming a causal graph. Have a look at the tutorial.

Further, Tigramite provides several causal discovery methods that can be used under different sets of assumptions. An application always consists of a method and a chosen conditional independence test, e.g. PCMCIplus together with ParCorr. The following two tables give an overview of the assumptions involved:

| Method | Assumptions         | Output |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
|         |   (in addition to Causal Markov Condition and Faithfulness)   |    |
| PCMCI  | Causal stationarity, no contemporaneous causal links, no hidden variables |  Directed lagged links, undirected contemporaneous links (for tau_min=0)  |
| PCMCIplus | Causal stationarity, no hidden variables    | Directed lagged links, directed and undirected contemp. links (Time series CPDAG) |
| LPCMCI | Causal stationarity    | Time series PAG |
| RPCMCI  | No contemporaneous causal links, no hidden variables |  Regime-variable and causal graphs for each regime with directed lagged links, undirected contemporaneous links (for tau_min=0)  |
| J-PCMCI+ | Multiple datasets, causal stationarity, no hidden system confounding, except if context-related   | Directed lagged links, directed and undirected contemp. links (Joint time series CPDAG) |


| Conditional independence test | Assumptions                                                                                            |
| :-- | :-- | 
| ParCorr                       | univariate, continuous variables with linear dependencies and Gaussian noise                           |
| RobustParCorr                 | univariate, continuous variables with linear dependencies, robust for different marginal distributions |
| ParCorrWLS                    | univariate, continuous variables with linear dependencies, can account for heteroskedastic data        |
| GPDC / GPDCtorch              | univariate, continuous variables with additive dependencies                                            |
| CMIknn                        | multivariate, continuous variables with more general dependencies (permutation-based test)             |
| Gsquared                      | univariate discrete/categorical variables                                                              |
| CMIsymb                       | multivariate discrete/categorical variables (permutation-based test)                                   |
| RegressionCI                  | mixed datasets with univariate discrete/categorical and (linear) continuous variables                  |
| CMIknnMixed                  | mixed datasets with multivariate discr./cat./cont. variables with more general dependencies (permutation-based test)                  |

Remark: With the conditional independence test wrapper class PairwiseMultCI you can turn every univariate test into a multivariate test.

## General Notes

Tigramite is a causal inference for time series python package. It allows to efficiently estimate causal graphs from high-dimensional time series datasets (causal discovery) and to use graphs for robust forecasting and the estimation and prediction of direct, total, and mediated effects. Causal discovery is based on linear as well as non-parametric conditional independence tests applicable to discrete or continuously-valued time series. Also includes functions for high-quality plots of the results. Please cite the following papers depending on which method you use:

- numpy>=1.18
- scipy>=1.10.0
- numba>=0.56.4

## Optional packages depending on used functions
- scikit-learn>=1.2   # Gaussian Process (GP) Regression
- matplotlib>=3.7.0   # Plotting
- seaborn>=0.12.2     # Plotting
- networkx>=3.0       # Plotting

## Installation

python setup.py install

This will install tigramite in your path.

To use just the ParCorr, CMIknn, and CMIsymb independence tests, only numpy/numba and scipy are required. For other independence tests more packages are required:

- GPDC: scikit-learn is required for Gaussian Process regression and dcor for distance correlation

- GPDCtorch: gpytorch is required for Gaussian Process regression

Note: Due to incompatibility issues between numba and numpy, we currently enforce soft dependencies on the versions.
