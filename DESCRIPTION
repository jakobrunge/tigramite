Title: The Randomized Conditional Independence Test (RCIT) and the Randomized
    conditional Correlation Test (RCoT)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eric V. Strobl

Description:  RCIT and RCoT are approximate conditional independence tests that use random Fourier features to approximate a kernel conditional independence test called KCIT. RCIT and RCoT are significantly faster than KCIT while at least as accurate.
