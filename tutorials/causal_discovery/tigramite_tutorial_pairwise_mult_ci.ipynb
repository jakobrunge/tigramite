    "\n",
    "Suppose one has random vectors $X, Y, Z$ (each potentially multivariate) and suppose that one  wants to decide whether $X$ is independent of $Y$ given $Z$ (that is, the conditional densities (assuming they exist) factorize: $\\forall x,y,z:\\;p_{X,Y|Z=z}(x,y) = p_{X|Z=z}(x)\\cdot p_{Y|Z=z}(y)$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to test independence between $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$ is to test whether all components $X_i$ and $Y_j$ are independent given $Z$.\n",
    "The conditional independence test PairwiseMultCI builds on this pairwise idea. PairwiseMultCI tests independence between each pair of components $X_i$ and $Y_j$ given $(Z,S_{ij}).$ Here, $S_{ij}$ is a set that consists of components of either $X$ or $Y$ that are independent of $Y_j$ or $X_i$. One can show that including these components increases the effect size of the corresponding test. To choose between the pairwise independence testing with and without increased conditioning sets, there is the boolean parameter ``learn_augmented_cond_sets``. Setting it to False will lead to pairwise independence testing without increased conditioning sets, setting it to true will lead to increased conditioning sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, these sets $S_{ij}$ are usually not known a priori and hence need to be learned.\n",
    "PairwiseMultCI first learns these conditional independencies on one part of the sample and then uses these conditional independencies to do the testing on the second part of the sample. The sample splitting ratio (``pre_step_sample_fraction``) is a hyperparameter, as is the significance level ($\\alpha_{pre}$) for learning independencies in the first step. (We think that only a small part of the sample should be used for learning independencies in the first step, moreover, $\\alpha_{pre}$ should be rather large to only mark something as independent if there is strong evidence). As a small side remark, setting ``pre_step_sample_fraction`` to $0$ is the same as setting ``learn_augmented_cond_sets`` to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "We remark that PairwiseMultCI is a \"meta-algorithm\", that is, it is a framework that works with several univariate test statistics. Because of that, PairwiseMultCI also has the parameter cond_ind_test, which can be any other conditional independence test from tigramite/independence_tests"

When working with fixed_thres, instead of working with the significance level $\\alpha_{pre},$ one needs to specify a threshold for the pre-step, called fixed_thres_pres. "
